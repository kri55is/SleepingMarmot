# SleepingMarmot
Android application 

Every night it is the same :  stop wifi and set the phone to vibrate.
Every morning it is the same : start wifi and restore the ring mode to normal.

Sleepmot will do it for you!

Hey, what's the difference with the priority mode? Good question :-p ! 
The difference is that with Sleepmot, the wifi is off and doesn't consume battery whereas the priority mode is only turning the notifications off, the wifi is on and consumes battery. Also, with Sleepmot, you can setup the ringer mode to Vibrate when you receive a call. With the priority mode calls will either ring or trigger nothing, you cannot set it up to just vibrate.

Hey, why don't I use the plane mode then?
In plane mode you cannot receive calls. I like to be reachable in case of emergency.
